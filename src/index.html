	<h1>Informacion</h1>
  
	<p>
		sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis), or southern lights (aurora
		australis),
		is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the
		Arctic and Antarctic).
	</p>
	<p>
		Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. These disturbances are
		sometimes strong enough to alter the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric
		plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere
		(thermosphere/exosphere).
	</p>
	<p>
		The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and
		complexity.
		The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of
		acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical
		emissions
		as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed
		at
		lower latitudes.[2]
